# Pokémon Gen 2 Clock Reset Calculator

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/sk84uhlivin/pokemon-gen2-clockreset-calculator/releases/tag/v1.0). This calculator was designed to output the clock reset password for Gen 2 Pokémon games. While there are many other calculators that do the same thing out there, I wanted something that I could use quickly on the NumPad portion of the keyboard. Just type your Name, Trainer ID, and Password with an Enter press in between, and you have your password.
